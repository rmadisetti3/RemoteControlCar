# Remote Control Car
### GT ECE 4180 Final Project

##### Team Members
Raj Madisetti and Arjun Sonti

#### Project Idea
Our idea for this project was to create a remote control car that is operated by an mbed microcontroller in order to allow basic forward, reverse, and turning movements along with autopilot functionality. All user inputs would be sent via the Adafruit Bluefruit LE Connect App available on all mobile phones allowing for an easy and convenient experience. For autopilot, three sensors would be mounted on the front to allow the RC car to detect obstacles and turn accordingly.
